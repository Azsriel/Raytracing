# Raytracing
First attempt at raytracing
Followed Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley 
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview

Things to do later:
Implement parallel processing and multithreading (current output took over 40 minutes to write onto ppm file)
Implement more shapes

New things learnt:
first time making a project with more that a couple header files and classes
first time using shared pointers
first time actually using math in a program
